# Solids1.0
Solids is a tool written in Python used for crystal structure prediction. It relies on two different algorithms to perform energy ladscape 
explorations: A Metaheuristic (kindly referred to as Kick) designed for a quick exploration and a Modified Genetic Algorithm (GA) for more 
throug explorations. The first scheme builds random structures, relaxes them with one of the interfaced codes and presents the results. The 
second scheme is more thorough in the exploration by applying operators of mutation and hereditary.
